                <h4 class="timeline-title">Whiskey or whisky is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash.</h4>
                <p class="timeline-text">It is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.</p>

                <h4 class="timeline-title">
                  The type of grain used varies with the kind of whiskey being made, but all whiskeys contain at least a small amount of malted barley.
                </h4>

                  <ul>
                  <li>Get grains and store them in silos. Then, clean the grains.</li>
                  <li>If its barley:
                    <ol>
                      <li>Malting is needed.</li>
                      <li>Malting: soaking in water for sufficient time and then keep it spread open till it starts to sprout.</li>
                      <li>After sprouts, a certain enzyme called ‘amylase’ converts the barley into sugars.</li>
                      <li>Once sprouting starts, dry the barley and then ground it.</li>

                <h4 class="timeline-title">The liquid combination of malt and water is called the 'mash'.</h4>
                <p class="timeline-text">The dried malt is ground into a coarse flour or grist, which is mixed with hot water in the mash tun. The water is added in 3 stages and gets hotter at each stage, starting around 67°C and rising to almost boiling point. The mash is stirred, helping to convert the starches to sugar. After mashing, the sweet sugary liquid is known as wort.</p>

                <h4 class="timeline-title">The result of mashing the malt is a sugar solution called wort. To convert this sugar into alcohol a fermentation progress is necessary and therefore yeast has to be added.</h4>
                <p class="timeline-text">As yeast can’t stand hot temperatures the wort is cooled down to about 20°C before it is married with the yeast in washbacks. The yeast can either be put directly into the wort in the condition it arrives in the distillery or it is dissolved and prepared in a small extra mixer to start a faster fermentation.</p>

                <h4 class="timeline-title"> Distillation is where the alcohol created during fermentation is removed from the wash to form a concentrated liquid that goes on to be matured into Whiskey.</h4>
                <p class="timeline-text">The product of the initial distillation, known as low wine, is distilled a second time to produce a product known as high wine or new whiskey, which contains about 70% alcohol.</p>

                <h4 class="timeline-title">Whiskey is mostly aged in wooden barrels, charred white oak. The quality of the barrels is carefully monitored because the new spirit is to gain character and color from the wood in which it rests.
              </h4>
                <article class="timeline-text">
                During aging, three things happen.
                <ul>
                  <li>First: water, alcohol and congeners mix with each other over time.</li>
                  <li>Second: the reaction of water, alcohol and congeners with oxygen.</li>
                  <li>Third: the interaction of water, alcohol and congeners with wood.</li>
                </ul>
              All these factors contribute towards ageing. Typically it takes 3-5 years for a whiskey to mature.</article>

                <h4 class="timeline-title">
                  Blended whiskeies are produced by mixing different types of whiskey together. Blending create a smoother, more complex drink with each part bringing its own characteristics to the blend. 
                </h4>
                <article class="timeline-text">
                  Blending also means adding more things for flavor like neutral grain spirit. Caramel addition helps in getting a color, sheery or wine also helps in blending for flavor reasons.
                  <ul>
                  <li> A single malt whiskey is not blended. So once its out of cask, its bottled.</li>
                  <li>All other whiskeys are blended.</li>

                <h4 class="timeline-title">Glass is always used to store mature whiskey because it does not react with it to change the flavor.</h4>
                <p class="timeline-text">The bottles are usually labelled with the name of the distillery, the cask type, distillation and bottling date, and sometimes with the cask and bottle number.</p>
